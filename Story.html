		<p> 	This is a short story about <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/meganchristy__/">Megan Christy</a>. She is fourteen years old, in ninth grade at <a href= "http://www.stmarksschool.org/">St. Marks school</a>  .  She has one sister and two dogs. In her free time she likes to player soccer, lacrosse, and especially squash.  <br>   </p>

		<p> 	One day, she was playing <a href= "http://www.usopensquash.com/squash/">squash</a> with her friends, and got hit in the face with a squash racquet! She fell to the ground in pain only to  notice that the squash racquet had broken! Megan and her opponent both were on the verge of tears. <br> </p>

		<p> 	After this day, her life was never the same. She feared the squash court and had not entered it after that horrific day.  Eventually one day her friends realized she had not played in a while and forced onto the court. She slowly eased into practicing and eventually regained her confidence until she was back to her former <a href= "http://www.stmarksschool.org/welcome/athletics/team-page/index.aspx?TeamID=1548" > 3rds squash</a> glory. <br> </p>

		<p> 	The biggest squash tournamnet  of the year was approaching, and Megan was only getting better and better. The day of the tournament arrived, and Megan did everything she could to forget about a day not to long ago that had changed her squash career forever, and instead spent all morning practing her amazing <a href= "http://racquet.about.com/od/playsquash/ss/SquashServeLam.htm"> serves</a> and hits. Later that day as she strode onto the court, prepared to defeat her opponent, she tripped, and once again landed on her face. But, this time she had the strength and confidence to stand back up and win the tournament! <br> </p>

		<p> 	This great story has taught Megan to never give up no matter how many times she fell, and hopefully it helped you too!  </p>
